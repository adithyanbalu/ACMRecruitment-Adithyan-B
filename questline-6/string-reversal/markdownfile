## Iterative Method
- Loop through the string from the end to the beginning.
- Append each character to a new string.
- Return the new reversed string.

**Code:**

function reverse_iterative(s):
result = ""
for i from length(s)-1 down to 0:
result = result + s[i]
return result

## Recursive Method
- Base case: if the string is empty or has one character, return it.
- Recursive step: return last character + recursive call on substring (excluding last character).

**Code:**

function reverse_recursive(s):
if length(s) <= 1:
return s
return s[-1] + reverse_recursive(s[0 :length(s)-1])

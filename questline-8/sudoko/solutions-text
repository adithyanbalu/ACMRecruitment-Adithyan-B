Given grid:
- - 3 -
- 3 - 1
3 - - -
- 1 - -

logic:
1 Start by filling numbers that are already given.
2 Apply the rule: each row, column, and 2x2 box must have numbers 1-4 with no repeats.
3 Look at each empty cell and determine possible values by eliminating numbers already present in:
   The same row
   The same column
   The same 2 x 2 subgrid
4 Use deduction to fill in cells that have only one possible value.
5 Repeat elimination and filling until the grid is completed.

Solved Grid:
1 2 3 4
4 3 2 1
3 4 1 2
2 1 4 3

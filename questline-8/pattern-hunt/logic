EVEN NUMBERS STARTING FROM '4' ARE ADDED TO PRECEDING NUMBERS

first number in the sequence is 2
where 2+4=6; which is the second number in the sequence

second number = 6
where next even number ie; 6
where 6+6=12;which is the third number in the sequence

third number = 12
where next even number ie; 8
where 12+8=20;which is the fourth number in the sequence

fourth number = 20
where next even number ie; 10
where 20+10=30;which is the fifth number in the sequence

fifth number = 30
where next even number ie; 12
where 30+12 = 42;which is the sixth number in the sequence

so next two numbers in the sequence will be 30 and 42

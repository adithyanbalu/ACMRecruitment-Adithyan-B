Bridge and Torch Optimization â€“ Solution

Crossing Times:
- Person A: 1 min
- Person B: 2 min
- Person C: 7 min
- Person D: 10 min

Sequence:

1. A and B cross together (2 min)
2. A returns with the torch (1 min)
3. C and D cross together (10 min)
4. B returns with the torch (2 min)
5. A and B cross again (2 min)

Total Time = 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes

Reasoning:
- Sending the two fastest (A and B) first allows them to return the torch quickly.
- The two slowest (C and D) cross together only once.
- This minimizes the back-and-forth and optimizes for the higher crossing times.
